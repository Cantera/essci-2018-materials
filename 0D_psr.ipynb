    "In this example, we will explore another use of user-defined functions. In Cantera, we can connect several components together to create an open control volume, rather than the closed batch reactor we used to conduct constant U-V simultions previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfectly stirred reactors are one such example. The PSR is typically a constant volume reaction chamber with a single inlet and outlet to allow flow in and out. In Cantera, we can use several components to control the flow rate in a `Reactor`, including a `Valve`, which calculates the mass flow rate by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{m} = K(P_1 - P_2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $K$ is a constant. Another option is a `MassFlowController`, which sets the mass flow rate to the specified value, regardless of the pressure difference. In this example, we will use a `Valve` between the upstream condition and the reactor, to maintain the reactor at constant pressure; and we will use a `MassFlowController` to control the overall mass flow rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conducting experiments with PSR-analogs, the experimentalists might hold the residence time of the reactants in the reactor constant and vary the inlet conditions (equivalence ratio, temperature, etc.), perhaps to measure the mole fractions of the products coming out of the reactor. Cantera does not have a pre-defined function to set a constant residence time, but we can use a user-defined function to calculate the mass flow rate required to give a certain residence time. Essentially, we will divide the mass of the gas in the reactor by the residence time, and set the mass flow rate through the `MassFlowController` with this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration for this function comes from a post on the User Group: (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cantera-users/dMUhi5kVVDk/bDFYWMQsgbAJ)"

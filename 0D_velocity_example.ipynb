    "Cantera can solve the coupled energy and species equations for zero-dimensional reactors. For further details of the actual equations that are solved, see the documentation: http://cantera.org/docs/sphinx/html/reactors.html The 0-D reactors have a number of options that enable them to model a wide range of systems, including user-controlled varying volume, heat transfer into or out of the environment, mass flow into and out of the system, and surface kinetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively, there are two major choices the user must make in desiging the model of the basic system. The first is whether the reactor solves the general energy equation (solved in terms of the mixture enthalpy) or the ideal gas energy equation (solved in terms of the temperature). In general, the two methods will give the same solution to the problem; however, if the system can be modeled as an ideal gas, the ideal gas equation tends to be more robust and faster.\n",

    "The agreement between the experiment and the model is quite good, although it is clear there is some experimental detail that is missing. We can account for this detail (the compression stroke and post-compression heat-loss) by changing the volume of the `IdealGasReactor` to model the processes in the experiment. The volume of the reactor can be changed by considering it as a piston-cylinder assembly. The area of the piston is constant, and the rate of change of the volume is the velocity of the piston. It is this velocity that must be specified to the reactor to change its volume. First, we will define a class with the special `__call__` that returns the velocity at a point in time. The time is passed as the argument to the `__call__` function."
